# How to read the file names
    * Read the filename like this: {descrpition}_{generation}_{scene}
    * If the descrpition is emtpy it will be replaced with "image". This signifies that there
    is no special options, like anti aliasing and stuff like that.
    * The scenes (numerated) is listed in the scenes.md file in a code format
